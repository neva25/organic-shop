# Organic Shop

This project demonstrates a simple e-commerce application for an imaginary organic shop. It is built with Angular, Firebase and Bootstrap 5.

## Important 

Before running this application on your machine, create a Firebase project. You need to replace the Firebase settings I've defined in /src/environments with the settings of your own Firebase project.
